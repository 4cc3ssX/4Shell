# pyshell
This two script is the command shell using python and it can be used with netcat but if u wanna use 'cd' u can use example like 'cd /home/user/Desktop; ls -al'. Server script must be stay in victim and client must be in attacker. 

You can share after updating my script or adding new feature but please put original author name and share back to me of new feature source code.
